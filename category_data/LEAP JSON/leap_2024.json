But this week, we’re talking about founder-led marketing, and Prince’s words just felt right. Because, like musicians, founders bring something completely new into the world. When they lead their company’s marketing, they’re sharing that creative journey and inspiring others to do the same. Curious to learn more? We’ve got 4 great examples of tech founders using this strategy to build their brands. Read the newsletter here: https://bit.ly/4dQvYb6 #LEAP25",

This journey led us to an exciting partnership and event planning in Surabaya & Malang. Meeting the GITP Indonesia team by chance in Jakarta turned into an incredible opportunity—we’ll soon be signing a collaboration MoU to expand into Indonesia! It was also great reconnecting with Ms. Miki Bito, whom I first met at the Japan-Malaysia Tech Innovate Business Program in KL—then she’s here with us at AI Everything! Connecting with our local partner The Catalyst @catalystuae Swethal and GITEX Global @gitex_global made the experience even more rewarding. Big thanks to Viveka from Singapore for introducing me to Anant—excited about the potential collaboration! Also grateful to my good buddy Masataka from Tokyo for joining me here and soon at LEAP Riyadh. Lastly, again wanna thank you Lord, for this incredible journey that brought GITP together with Ignyte @ignyteevents , GSI, and many more. This has been a fantastic trip, and tomorrow, we head to LEAP Saudi Arabia! @leapandinnovate Appreciate MDEC’s @mymdec support, and I look forward to meeting my fellow Malaysian entrepreneurs there.
